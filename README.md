# odin-to-do-list
It's a To-Do list website made as a part of The Odin Project assignment.

You can create To-dos and set the title, description, priority, date and also you can make it a part of a project.
If you want your todo to be a part of an existing project, you can see the projects' names in dropdown menu.
The circle counters in the navigation menu display the amount of todos for each time period.
To manage time formatting I used the functions from [date-fns.org](https://date-fns.org/) library.

There is also "Notes" page where you can create notes and then edit them right from the main page.

Todos and notes are stored in `localStorage`. When the page is loaded for the first time default todos and notes are created.
